    <h3>What is LoFi?</h3>
        <p>LoFi is a style and an aesthetic used in music, video, fashion and other media. It is characterised by serenity, gentleness, human warmth and androgyny, and often explores the everyday human experience.</p>
        <p>LoFi can be many things.

            <ul>
                <li>It can be a serene trainride.<br>
                    <img src="img/02-trainride.png" width=500 height=375 alt="A woman looking out of the window of a train as it passes a waterfall.">
                </li> <br>
                <li>It can be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slice_of_life"></a>slice of life</a>.<br>
                    <img src="img/03-slice.jpg" width=323 height=400 alt="Three friends sitting on a rooftop overlooing a city suburb, drinking beers. A dog naps nearby."></li><br>
                <li>It can be a warm home.<br>

                <li>It can be retrofuturism.<br>
                    <img src="img/05-retro.gif" width=434 height=750 alt="A pixelart image of a room lined with ceiling-heigh shelves co0ntaining neatly organised files. In the middle of the room is a computer on a desk, and a chair. Green text flickers on the computer screen">
                </li><br>
                <li>It can be cats. Cats are extremely lo-fi.<br>

    <h3>LoFi Subjectivity</h3>
        <p>LoFi is a state of mind. It is therefore subjective. For each person it is different.</p>
        <p>Here are fifteen things I consider to be LoFi...
            <ol>
                <li>calm</li>
                <li>gentleness</li>
                <li>comfort</li>
                <li>serenity</li>
                <li>self-love</li>
                <li>loving friends</li>
                <li>holding hands</li>
                <li>soft sunshine</li>
                <li>the smell of the forest</li>
                <li>walking on concrete</li>
                <li>napping on the couch in a white walled apartment, leafy trees filtering the sunlight through the window</li>
                <li>chiffon cake</li>
                <li>a hoodie that is perfectly too large</li>
                <li>lowercase text</li>
                <li>bubblegum bottle gummies</li>
            </ol>
        </p>


    <h3>LoFi Specialists</h3>
        <p>Some individuals specialise in creating lofi content.</p>
        <p>For example, some artists train excruciatingly relaxedly to create LoFi artwork.

<h3>LoFi Cheatsheet</h3>

<p> Here's a lo-fi cheatsheet to help you tell if somethig is lo-fi or not. Please note that it is neither exhaustive nor absolute.</p>



<!--table of random things(shells, milkshakes, companies) with a lo-fi rating of 0 to 10. 10 is very lo-fi. 0 is not lo-fi.-->


<p> Our research is ongoing. Please help our efforts by marking the following items as either lo-fi or not lo-fi.</p>

<!-- a second table, this one of more objects, and two columns: lo-fi and not lo-fi (radio I guess). each column contains a radio button pair.-->

<p> To further aid our research please enter some things which you suspect may be lo-fi into the form below.</p>

<!-- form for entering 5 lo-fi things, followed by a button to submit. -->

<p> Since you're already helping us out could you please feed our cat too?</p>

<!-- a button labelled 'feed the cat'. Links to a html page that just shows Boris eating food with anothe rbutton, a link, that goes back to the original page.-->
