        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm a scientist living in Manchester, UK. I share a house with my partner, our lodger and a very dashing pet cat. I've 2 degrees in Chemistry (BSc, MSc by Research) and I currently work as a senior R&D chemist for an international protective coatings firm. Despite my success in the field I'm preparing for a career shift to web development. The reasons for this can be found in the <a href="#">motivation</a> section below. Tl;dr: it's because software engingeering is super cool.
        <br>
        My current aim is to acquire the skills I need in order to assume my first web development position within 6 months. I'm starting with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, then I'll progress to test-driven development, express.js, APIs and REACT. By that point I'll be capable of full-stack development of web applications, I'll be ready to seek employment in the field, and I'll be ready to devise my next scheme!
        <br>
        My interests include hiking, rockclimbing, digital art and videogames. I follow podcasts on design, economics, politics and sociology, as well as some lighter bits. You can find some of my favourites in the <a href="#">Interests</a> section.

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p> I started learning about computer science a few years ago, when I began working through a fantastic book called <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/book">The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Pricniples</a> by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. It's the hardcopy version of their <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">NAND to Tetris</a> course which summarises how computers function mechanically, starting at the level of logic gates and building up to operating systems and programs. I read it out of curiosity. I identified comupter science as a gap in my knowledge, and being the sort of person who likes to know how things work I decided to check it out. Tinkering with logic and seeing how simple systems could be built up and manipulated to represent complex abstract concepts was a lot of fun.
        <br>
        I feel that play is one of our species' most valuable traits. It's the means by which we come to understand our world and through which we develop the technologies that enhance our lived experience. To my mind that is one of the paramount aims of our civilisation: improving quality of life. There's little point in creation without purpose, and purpose is inherently founded in the needs of real people.
        <br>
        Play is also a great means of interacting with people. It helps us build strong relationships through shared experiences and mutual investment. Collaboration is a powerful tool for building products <em>and</em> relationships.
        <br>
        Given these leanings it may not be surprising that I decided to pursue a career in science, a field founded on curiosity, experimentation, creation and cooperation. I have 2 chemistry degrees and about seven years of industrial experience, five in chemical recovery and two in protective coatings.
        <br>
        I've been considering changing career to web development for a couple of years now. Although I enjoy chemistry some aspects of the industry aren't brilliant, and software development is a very attractive field. I'm adept at problem-solving and functional design (though my visual design skills could use some work), and I'm confident in my ability to learn the skills specific to the trade. The industry is blooming and opportunities are rife. It really excites me to think that I can continue to contribute to the development of useful technologies in this new field. 
        <br>
        The main thing that has held me back is the sunk-cost fallacy. I've invested a huge amount of time and effort in my chemistry career. It's a lot to leave behind. That said, and although my career is progressing well, I'm no longer convinced that it is the most fulfilling route I can take. Web development presents so many compelling opportunities. I don't want to miss them. I want to play with these technologies. I want to make incredible new tools. I want to collaborate with people in the development of global internet infrastructure, one of our species' most significant inventions. Software engineering is incredible and I want to be a part of it. I'm working hard to achieve this. It'll be worth the effort. </p>

                <p>I always feel like I'm cheating when i include food as an interest. Everyone eats, most people cook, and who doesn't enjoy eating out? That said, it is a sincere interest, and <! list some of your favourite restaurants in manhcester. Include images. Can we includ elinks to online resources?</p>
