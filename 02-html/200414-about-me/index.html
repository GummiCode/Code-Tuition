        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p> I started learning about computer science a few years ago, when I began working through a fantastic book called <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/book">'The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Pricniples'</a> by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. This book is the hardcopy version of their 'From NAND to Tetris' course which explains how computers function, starting at the level of logic gates and building up to operating systems and programs. I read it out of curiosity. I'm the sort of person who likes to know how things work, and at the time computer science was a big gap in my knowledge.
        <br>
        Tinkering with logic and seeing how simple systems could be manipulated to represent abstract concepts (prediminantly mathematics) was a lot of fun. </p>
