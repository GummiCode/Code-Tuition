    <h3>Nth Element Selectors</h3>
    <p>Various selectors exist to select sibling elements at specific positions, eg first, third etc. Repeating patterns, eg. every 3rd element, can also be established.</p>
    <p>A cheatsheet to the relevant rules can be found <a href:"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Pseudo-classes_and_pseudo-elements">here</a>. Go to the 'nth' section.</p>
