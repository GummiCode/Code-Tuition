    <h1 style="color: mediumslateblue;background-color: mediumaquamarine;border: 5px groove black;">Hello World!</h1>
    <p style="color:brown;">This is my third CSS example. It uses inline styles embedded in the HTML.</p>
    <p style="color:brown; font-weight:bold;">Do not use inline styles unless absolutely necessary! It's inefficent to implement and maintain, it's disorganised and it's relatively difficult to read.</p>
    <p style="color:brown;">There are some exceptions to this rule. For example emails sometimes have inline CSS to make them compatible with as many email clients as possible..</p>
