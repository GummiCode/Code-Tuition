        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I currently live in Manchester, UK, with my partner, our lodger and a very dashing pet cat. I've 2 degrees in Chemistry (BSc, MSc by Research) and I currently work as a senior R&D chemist for an international protective coatings firm. Despite my success in the field I'm preparing for a career shift to web development. The reasons for this can be found in the <a href="#">motivation</a> section below. Tl;dr: it's because software engingeering is super cool.</p>
        <p>My current aim is to acquire the skills I need in order to assume my first web development position within 6 months. I'm starting with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, then I'll progress to test-driven development, express.js, APIs and REACT. By that point I'll be capable of full-stack development of web applications, I'll be ready to seek employment in the field, and I'll be ready to devise my next scheme!</p>
        <p>My interests include hiking, rockclimbing, digital art and videogames. I follow podcasts on software engineering, design, economics, politics, sociology and LGBTQ+ issues, as well as some lighter bits. You can find some of my favourites in the <a href="#">Interests</a> section.

    <section class="section" id="motivation">
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p> I started learning about computer science a few years ago, when I began working through a fantastic book called <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/book">The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Pricniples</a> by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. It's the hardcopy version of their <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">NAND to Tetris</a> course which summarises how computers function mechanically, starting at the level of logic gates and building up to operating systems and programs. I read it out of curiosity. I identified comupter science as a gap in my knowledge, and being the sort of person who likes to know how things work I decided to check it out. Tinkering with logic and seeing how simple systems could be built up and manipulated to represent complex abstract concepts was a lot of fun.</p>

        <p>I feel that play is one of our species' most valuable traits. It's the means by which we come to understand our world and through which we develop the technologies that enhance our lived experience. To my mind that is one of the paramount aims of our civilisation: improving quality of life. There's little point in creation without purpose, and purpose is inherently founded in the needs of real people.</p>
        <p>Play is also a great means of interacting with people. It helps us build strong relationships through shared experiences and mutual investment. Collaboration is a powerful tool for building products <em>and</em> relationships.</p>

        <p>Given these leanings it may not be surprising that I decided to pursue a career in science, a field founded on curiosity, experimentation, creation and cooperation. I have 2 chemistry degrees and about seven years of industrial experience, five in chemical recovery and two in protective coatings.</p>
        <p>I've been considering changing career to web development for a couple of years now. Although I enjoy chemistry some aspects of the industry aren't brilliant, and software development is a very attractive field. I'm adept at problem-solving and functional design (though my visual design skills could use some work), and I'm confident in my ability to learn the skills specific to the trade. The industry is blooming and opportunities are rife. It really excites me to think that I can continue to contribute to the development of useful technologies in this new field.</p>

        <p>The main thing that has held me back is the sunk-cost fallacy. I've invested a huge amount of time and effort in my chemistry career. It's a lot to leave behind. That said, and although my career is progressing well, I'm no longer convinced that it is the most fulfilling route I can take. Web development presents so many compelling opportunities. I don't want to miss them. I want to play with these technologies. I want to make incredible new tools. I want to collaborate with people in the development of global internet infrastructure, one of our species' most significant inventions. Software engineering is incredible and I want to be a part of it. I'm working hard to achieve this. It'll be worth the effort. /p>

        <h3>Interests</h3>
            <section class="subsection" id="podcasts">
                <h4>Podcasts</h4>
                <p>I'm a pretty active person so I don't commit a huge amount of time to sitting down in front of a TV. Instead I consume podcasts while I potter. Podcasts are a fantastic source of information. They effectively act as a programmable radio stream. Just like TV streaming, this allows us to change our consumer habits to focus on content of specific interest to us. </p>

                <p>Below I've picked out some of my favourite podcasts in 6 areas of specific interest to me: software development, design, econimics, politics, sociology and LGBTQ+ issues.</p>

                <ul>    
                    <li> <h6><strong>Software Development:</strong> <a href="https://www.codenewbie.org/">CodeNewbie</a></h6>
                    <p>This show consists of interviews with coders at various points in their careers, with a focus on how they entered the industry and the lessons they've learned along the way. I've used it to keep learning while in situations that don't permit me to actively code such as when driving or doing chores.</p> </li>

                    <li> <h6><strong>Design:</strong> <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/">99% Invisible</a></h6>
                    <p>Undoubtedly one of the most curious podcasts I've come across, 99% Invisible tells the stories of "the unnoticed architecture and design that shapes our world". Episodes cover topics ranging from <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-infantorium/">the spread of incubators for premature birth care in American fairgrounds</a>, mysterious <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/numbers-stations/">"number stations"</a> which distribute strange and seemingly meaningless sequences of numbers and sounds via shortwave radio, < href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-house-that-came-in-the-mail/">mail-order DIY homes in 50s USA</a> and <a href=https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/mannequin-pixie-dream-girl/>Cynthia, the mannequin that became an influential A-list celebrity in the 1930s</a>. I came across the show when I was learning about <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/episode-66-kowloon-walled-city/">Kowloon Walled City</a>; they have a brilliant episode on the topic.</p> </li>

                    <li> <h6><strong>Econimics:</strong> <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510289/planet-money/">Planet Money</a></h6>
                    <p>I had a huge gap in my knowledge where econimics should be so I put some effort into filling it. I read some books on the topic. I found some of them fairly frustrating, particularly those that advocated conservative neoliberal notions which seemed quite simplistic, and which assume systems would operate in an ideal manner despite ample real-life evidence to the contrary. People are complex and flexible and our behaviours can vary immensely when we're faced with unusual circumstances, and when rules are enacted to adjust our habits. Planet Money looks at real-world examples of economic theory where classical assumtions break down or, indeed, are exemplified in interesting concepts. It's a great primer in economics and it's very entertaining.</p> </li>

                    <li> <h6><strong>Politics and Sociology:</strong> <a href="https://www.cheerfulpodcast.com/">Reasons to be Cheerful</a></h6>
                    <p>Ed Milliband (previously the leader of the UK's Labour party) and comedian Geoff Lloyd invite guests to talk about progressive political and social ideas, bringing in lots of real-world examples of novel theory and practice. Topics covered include the gender pay gap, the four-day working week, fake news, land ownership, voter engagement and recognition of gender identity. The duo strike and absolutely charming tone.</p> </li>
                     
                    <li> <h6><strong>LGBTQ+ Issues:</strong> <a href="http://www.mattbaume.com/sewers-summary">The Sewers of Paris</a></h6>
                    <p>In this weekly podcast Matt Baume invites a guest to speak about the media that changed their life. The guests are predominatly gay men though people of other sexualities and gender identities are also featured. Many of the episodes are excellent; the personal stories told are diverse and enlightening. One of the lighter episodes delves deep into the forgotten history of the many <a href="http://www.mattbaume.com/sewers-shownotes/2019/8/14/gay-mens-catnip-ep-247-the-wizard-of-ozjosh-trujillo">Wizard of Oz interpretations</a> of the last century.</p></li>
                </ul>


            <section class="subsection" id="rockclimbing">
                <h4>Rockclimbing</h4>
                <p> As a child I used to think I wasn't "sporty". Football was the prevalent sport in my school, as it is in so many, and a filure to engage with it was commonly mistaken for a lack of physical aptitude.</p>

                <p>As a teenager I began to meet new people and explore ways of living that appealed to me rather than those prescribed by my direct social environment. This is when I discovered that I am, in fact, "sporty". Rockclimbing was one of the first sports that I found seriously engaging. My hometown of Sunderland boasted ownership of the highest indoor rockclimbing centre in Europe, the aptly named <a href="http://sunderlandwall.co.uk/">"Sunderland Wall"</a>. During my first visit I discovered the immense thrill of scrambling up vertical courses with an ever-enlarging void opening up below you, and an ever more precarious grip. I soon came to appreciate the technical challenges of the sport. Nothing quite simulates the rush of figuring out how to manipulate your body to reach a distant handhold while loosely holding yourself against a cliff face. The entire sport comes with inherent time limits in that your strength diminishes as you ascend. Learning to manage your energy is as much a part of the sport as learning to traverse difficult courses and enhancing your strength. It's an excellent physical and mental workout.<p>

                I currently boulder and climb at Manchester's <a href="https://www.theclimbingdepot.co.uk/manchester"></a>Climbing Depot</a>. I try to get there at least once a week.
                </p>

                <h4>Digital Art</h4>
                <p>To do.</p>
                <!--TODO: Digital Art Section-->

                <h4>Videogames</h4>
                <p>I'm not precisely a 'big' gamer. I find it hard to enjoy media that doesn't appeal to me quite strongly so I only occasionally play games and they're usually something fairly special. That said, I love to get engrossed in a good puzzle or an intriguing story when I've a little free time.</p>

                <p>I've identified a few recurring trends in my videogame tastes.</p>

                <p>I love a good puzzle game. Two of my favourites are Antichamber and The Talos Principle, both of which I consumed with gusto.</p>
               
                <p>I'm very fond of well-written character based stories, as well as good atmospheric horror games. SOMA ticks both of these boxes. It's one of of my all-time favourite games. I don't want to give any spoilers so I won't go into too much detail; I'll simply say that it's an intriguing existential horror with black comedy elements. You really ought to give it a go.<p>

                <p>I enjoy a good sandbox. Minecraft consumed a sizeable chunk of my free time when I lived in Sunderland. I'd play online with old uni friends. We'd build absurd structures, go spelunking, do silly things with the mechanics of the game. Subnautica is another exploratory sandbox that I'm eager to give a proper go, when time allows it.</p>

                <p>I'd also like to give honourable mentions to We Love Katamari, the WipEout series, Sonic the Hedgehog (STH1 to Sonic and Knuckles), Silent Hill 2 and Final Fantasy 7.</p>


                <h4>Food</h4>
                <p>I always feel like I'm cheating when i include food as an interest. Everyone eats, most people cook, and who doesn't enjoy eating out? That said, it is a sincere interest and it facilitates a lot of social activity. My partner and I frequently have dinner guests. We also eat out perhaps a little more than we ought to. It's difficult not to; there are <em>so many</em> good restaurants in Manchester! We're not precisely high-end though; there are plenty of tasty, resonably priced venues to choose from.
                <p>

                <h5>Five Fantastic Restaurants in Manchester</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li><h6><a class="list-head" href="https://www.tokyoramen.co.uk/"></a>Tokyo Ramen</h6>
                        <p class="list-item"><img src="images/tokyoramen.webp">If you eat here, eat at the bar. You can watch the chefs prepare food while you eat. The ramen is delicious. It's served in sensibly sized but ample portions.</p></li>
                        
                        <li><h6><a class="list-head" href="https://www.tokyoramen.co.uk/"></a>Wasabi</h6>
                        <p class="list-item"><img src="images/wasabi.png">I usually describe Wasabi as a conveyor belt sushi restaurant but that doesn't do justice to the breadth of their menu. They offer a sizeable range of japanese food to order including ramen, donburi, tempura and takoyaki. The venue in Chinatown includes a dessert restaurant on the first floor.</p></li>

                        <li><h6>Red & Hot</h6>
                        <p class="list-item"><img src="images/rednhot.jpg"> This is our go-to Szechuan hotpot spot. Szechuan hotpot is a communal cooking style in which a big pot of spicy, boiling broth is kept on the dinner table. Diners add meats and vegetables to the pot, and take them out when they're done. The food keeps rolling into and out of the pot. It's a paced, fun way to eat. The restaurant offers a wide range of ingredients to try and it all comes under a single 'buffet' price.
                        </p></li>

                        <li><h6>The Koffee Pot</h6>
                            <p class="list-item"><img src="images/koffeepot.png"> This cafe is an old favourite. Their focus is brunch; eggs benedict, croque monsieurs (et madames), reubens, brunch burgers and bloody marys. You can also get a mug of filter coffee or hot Vimto for £1. It's an excellent spot for a lazy Sunday morning.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
